# Pantry Pioneer

## Project Description

Pantry Pioneer is a web application that generates random recipes based on the ingredients users have on hand. Users can input the ingredients they have, and the app will fetch and display a list of recipes they can make with those ingredients. It can also provide details such as preparation instructions, cooking time, and health labels.

## Features

- User input for available ingredients.
- Fetch and display a list of recipes based on input.
- Display recipe details, including ingredients, preparation steps, and images.
- Include options for filtering by dietary preferences or cuisine types.
- Provide health labels (egg free, vegetarian, fish free, etc).
- User-friendly and responsive user interface.
